# Cat-Dog-Classification
Course Project for Computer Vision
This project is done by Keras with Tensorflow/Theano backend.
There are three files:
1 Random means initialize the VGG net from scratch
2 Finetuning means fine-tuning the VGG net based on ImageNet result.
3 Combind means using VGG, Inception, Resnet together for voting to get the result.
